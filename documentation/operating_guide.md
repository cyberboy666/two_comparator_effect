- To set up using the circuit plug an active video source into composite video input and a display into composite video output (flipping the bypass switch should show the raw video source passing through the circuit to the display)

- Next plug in a 5v center-positive power supply into the 2.1mm barrel jack connector – I like to use a usb wall charger for this

- switch the bypass again to activate the circuit - Adjusting the level knobs should change the resulting image – the thresholds control which brightness levels result in white black or gray regions.

- Depending on your display setting either or both knobs fully counter-clockwise can result in glitchy effects, colour bleeds and sync drops
