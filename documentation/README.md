# documentation

this project is fully open-source hardware - all the files required to build it are included in this repo for free. if you have the time and/or skill you can contribute back by collaborating on / testing new designs, improving these docs, making demo videos/other creative content etc. you can also support the project financially by donating directing, or purchasing through the web shop.

depending on whether you are going fully diy or buying an assembled and tested unit, some of the following guides will be relavent to you. the flow would be:

- [parts sourcing guide](./parts_sourcing_guide.md) (w/ notes on pcb fabracation ) - start here if you are building fully from scatch or have purchased a pcb
- [assembly guide](./assembly_guide.md) - start here if you have purchased a diy kit
- [operating guide](./operating_guide.md) - start here if you have purchased an assembled unit
