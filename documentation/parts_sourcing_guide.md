# ordering parts

i try to source all the parts i can from either:
- [tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) ; cheaper for common parts like resistors etc, also good for mechanical parts like switches and buttons
- [mouser](https://www.mouser.de/) ; has lots more options, speciality video ic's, can sometimes cost more (free shipping on orders over 50euros)
- other ; ocationally there will be parts which will need to be sourced elsewhere - usaully either aliexpress, ebay or amazon etc...

take a look at the full_bom for this project to see where i am sourcing the parts from

## import into tayda

- go to the [tayda quick order](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/quick-order/) and in bottom corner choose _add from file_
- select the file [tayda_bom.csv](../hardware/bom/tayda_bom.csv) in the BOM folder (you will have to download it first or clone this repo)
- after importing select _add to cart_
- __NOTE:__ the minimum value for resistors is 10, so you may need to modify these values to add to cart (or if they are already modified you will need to see the actual BOM for some part qty) 

## import into mouser

- go to [mouser bom tool](https://nz.mouser.com/Bom/) and click _upload spreadsheet_
- select the file [mouser_bom.csv](../hardware/bom/mouser_bom.csv) in this folder (you will have to download it first or clone this repo), then _upload my spreadsheet_ and _next_
- ensure that __Mouser Part Number__ is selected in the dropdown above the first row, then _next_, _process_
- if everything looks correct can now put _add to basket_
